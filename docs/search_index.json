They are designed to provide referring physicians and our trainees with general guidelines. In most cases, these cases are best cared for in a multi-disciplinary environment. Caring for patients with GI cancers is clearly a team support making use of the wisdom and experience of a broad-based teams of practitioners. These guidelines are not presented as Standard of Care. Readers interested in Standard of Care treatment protocols are referred to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCCN) Guidlines, which can be found at NCCN.org.

If uT2N0 on EUS, and PET scan shows a small tumor (MTV &lt;XX), primary surgery is reasonable in patients who are good surgical risks If T3 or N+ on EUS, if PET shows no metastatic disease, trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery is optimal) Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length &gt;3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be evaluated with PET scan. If PET shows disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes, trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery) is optimal. If PET shows metastatic disease, patients are eligible for palliative chemotherapy with radiation for treatment of symptoms of dysphagia. If PET shows extra-regional lymph node disease, patient is at high risk for distant disease and can be treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgicl evaluation. The first step in an efficient workup is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with) "],["diagnostic-evaluation.html", "Chapter 2 Diagnostic evaluation", " Chapter 2 Diagnostic evaluation The diagnosis of esophageal cancer is generally made at upper endscopy. Several findings at EGD are important in the subsequent workup and treatment: Location of the tumor from the incisors Length of the tumor Location of the gastroesophageal junction relative to the tumor Presence and extent of Barretts changes Presence and extent of invasion of tumor into the gastric cardia, particularly along the lesser curvature side. This is best seen with a retroflexed view "],["initial-evaluation.html", "Chapter 3 Initial evaluation 3.1 T1 3.2 T2N0 3.3 Surgery", " Chapter 3 Initial evaluation The staging workup begins once a diagnosis is made on endoscopy. The first step is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with) The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups: Patients with minimal dysphagia, no weight loss, and tumors with less than 3cm cranio-caudal extent have a reasonable change of being T1 or T2 tumors. Tumors &lt;3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those $$3cm[Hollis 1116] Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss. These tumors may present with bleeding, or with dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so endoscopic ultrasound is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis. Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, PET is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis. Patients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering [Ripley 226] among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia. PET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS [malik,claxton,1] showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm3, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median SUV of 35.7cm3. 3.1 T1 Endoscopic therapy likely sufficient[Pech Gastroenterology 2014 146:652] See MOlina JTCVS 153:1206 3.2 T2N0 Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 [Mariette 2416] Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.[MOta 176] French trial FREGAT[Markar 59] [Speicher 1195] 3.3 Surgery High volume Birkmeyer 2117;Wouters 1789;dikken 4068 You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??.
