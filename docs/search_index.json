They are designed to provide referring physicians and our trainees with general guidelines. In most cases, these cases are best cared for in a multi-disciplinary environment. Caring for patients with GI cancers is clearly a team support making use of the wisdom and experience of a broad-based teams of practitioners. These guidelines are not presented as Standard of Care. Readers interested in Standard of Care treatment protocols are referred to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCCN) Guidlines, which can be found at NCCN.org.

If uT2N0 on EUS, and PET scan shows a small tumor (MTV &lt;10cm^3), primary surgery is reasonable in patients who are good surgical risks If T3 or N+ on EUS, if PET shows no metastatic disease, trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery is optimal) Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length &gt;3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be evaluated with PET scan. If PET shows disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes, trimodality therapy (chemoradiation followed by surgery) is optimal. If PET shows metastatic disease, patients are eligible for palliative chemotherapy with radiation for treatment of symptoms of dysphagia. If PET shows extra-regional lymph node disease, patient is at high risk for distant disease and can be treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation. "],["diagnosis.html", "Chapter 2 Diagnosis", " Chapter 2 Diagnosis The diagnosis of esophageal cancer is generally made at upper endscopy. Several findings at EGD are important in the subsequent workup and treatment: Location of the tumor from the incisors Length of the tumor Location of the gastroesophageal junction relative to the tumor Presence and extent of Barretts changes Presence and extent of invasion of tumor into the gastric cardia, particularly along the lesser curvature side. This is best seen with a retroflexed view "],["staging.html", "Chapter 3 Staging 3.1 T1 3.2 Surgery", " Chapter 3 Staging The staging workup begins once a diagnosis is made on endoscopy. The first step is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with) The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups: Patients with minimal dysphagia, no weight loss, and tumors with less than 3cm cranio-caudal extent have a reasonable change of being T1 or T2 tumors. Tumors &lt;3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those $$3cm[Hollis 1116] Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss. These tumors may present with bleeding, or dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so endoscopic ultrasound is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis. Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, PET is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis. Patients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering [Ripley 226] among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia. PET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS [malik,claxton,1] showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm3, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median SUV of 35.7cm3. 3.1 T1 Endoscopic therapy is likely sufficient for small esophageal cancers which can be excised with negative margins.[Pech Gastroenterology 2014 146:652] Endoscopic musocal resection can be performed for nodular Barretts esophagus, in which case it is both diagnostic and potentially curative.

"],["t2n0-tumors.html", "Chapter 5 T2N0 Tumors", " Chapter 5 T2N0 Tumors Multiple studies have failed to show the additional benefit of chemotherapy or chemoradiation for pT2N0M0 esophageal cancer patients treated with radiation. Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 [Mariette 2416] Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.[MOta 176] French trial FREGAT(sarkar59?) Retrospective review of the National Cancer DataBase failed to demonstrate a difference in survival of cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer with or without preoperative chemoradiation.(Speicher et al. 2014) A retrospective report from Johns Hopkins examined outcomes of T2N0 squamous cell carcinoma patients and showed equivalent outcomes for primary surgery vs neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (Zhang et al. 2012) The challenge for treatment decision-making is the limited sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound in ruling out pT3 or pN+ disease. In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN+ disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation. In general, chemoradiation after esophagectomy is difficult for patients to tolerate, with a ___ % chance of failure to complete therapy. It is critical, therefore, in patients for whom primary surgery is contemplated, to attempt to identify those with occult T3 or N+ disease. Patients who appear to have limited stage disease benefit from evaluation with a combination of (MTV) (Tumor Length) (dysphagia) NCCN recommends PET scanS Most common sites of metastasis are liver, lung, bones, adrenal. PET detects occult metastasis in 10-20% of cases Kim et al. (2009 Mar-Apr). Among 129 patients with esophageal cancer, PET detected additional sites of disease in 41% and changed management in 38% (Chatterton et al. 2009) PET for restaging detects interval development of metastatic disease in 8-17% of cases (van Vliet et al. 2008) "],["locally-advanced-cancer.html", "Chapter 6 Locally Advanced Cancer 6.1 Minimally-invasive Esophagectomy 6.2 Trimodality Therapy 6.3 Definitive chemoradiation vs Trimodality therapy 6.4 Palliative radiation 6.5 Chemoradiation vs chemotherapy in Stage IV", " Chapter 6 Locally Advanced Cancer Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 6.1 Minimally-invasive Esophagectomy Higher lymph node yield with MIE vs open approach (Kalff et al. 2020) 6.2 Trimodality Therapy Trimodality therapy consists of chemoradiation followed by surgery. CROSS trial randomized patients with resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors to neoadjuvant chemoradiation consisting of 4,140 cGy of radiation with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel or surgery alone.(van Hagen et al. 2012) Pathologic complete response was seen in 18% of adenocarcinoma and XX% of squamous cell carcinomas. Median overall survival was 49 months after trimodality vs 24 months after surgery alone. Squamous cell carcinomas appeared to have particular benefit, with a hazard ratio of 0.42 for sqamous cell vs 0.74 for adenocarcinoma. This translated into a survival difference at 5 years of ___ vs ___ for squamous cell, compared with ___ vs ___ for adenocarcinoma. Despite the relatively low dose of radiation, in-field recurrences were less than 5%. The primary cause of failure was distant disease (31%) and local/regoinal failure (14%).(oppedijk385?) 6.3 Definitive chemoradiation vs Trimodality therapy Stahl Locally advaced squamous cell carcinoma radomized to induction chemotherapy (cisplatin, etopiside, 5FU with leuocovrin) followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent ciplatin and etopiside) followed by surgery compared with induction chemotherapy folowed by chemoradiation (6400cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etopiside).(stahl2310?) Treatment-related morality was substantial in the surgery arm (13% vs 4%). This would be considered an excessive rate of operative mortality by modern standards. Unsuprisingly, there was no difference in overall survival between groups, in part because the surgical group had an excess 9% mortality rate from treatment. Two-year survival in the surgery arm was 40% vs 35% in the definitive chemoradiation arm. In the French FFCD tria, 444 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (90% squamous cell) were treated with two cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin with concurrent radiation.(bedenne1160?) Patients with a partial or complete clinical response to chemoradiation were randomized to either surgery or a boost of radiation. Patients who did not respond to chemoradiation were treated with surgery and were eliminated from the study. Only 259 of the original 444 patients (59%) went on to randomization, with the remainder (those not responding to chemoradiation) treated with surgery. Of the randomized group, median survival was 17.7months in the surgery arm versus 19.3months in the definitive chemoradiation arm. Like the Stahl study, treatment-related mortality in the surgical arm was high (9% versus 1%). 6.3.1 Neoadjuvant chemotheraphy followed by surgery POET Trial (Pre-Operataive therapy in Esophageal adenocarcinoma Trial) treated patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction with either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU, leucovorin, cisplatin) followed by surgery or induction chemotherapy with the same agents, followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide). The study failed to meet its accrual goal, but there was a suggestion of improved 3-year survival with preoperative chemoradiation (47.4% vs 27.7% p=0.07).(Stahl et al. 2009). A meta-analysis of 33 randomized trials further suggested a greater benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with neoajuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery(pasquali481?) 6.4 Palliative radiation Palliative radiation vs chemoradiation (penniment114?)
