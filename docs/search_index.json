They are designed to provide referring physicians and our trainees with general guidelines. In most cases, these cases are best cared for in a multi-disciplinary environment. Caring for patients with GI cancers is clearly a team support making use of the wisdom and experience of a broad-based teams of practitioners. These guidelines are not presented as Standard of Care. Readers interested in Standard of Care treatment protocols are referred to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCCN) Guidlines, which can be found at NCCN.org.

These tumors may present with bleeding, or with dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so endoscopic ultrasound is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis. Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, PET is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis. 1.1 T1 Endoscopic therapy likely sufficient[Pech Gastroenterology 2014 146:652] See MOlina JTCVS 153:1206 1.2 T2N0 Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 [Mariette 2416] Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.[MOta 176] French trial FREGAT[Markar 59] [Speicher 1195] 1.3 Surgery High volume Birkmeyer 2117;Wouters 1789;dikken 4068 You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??.
