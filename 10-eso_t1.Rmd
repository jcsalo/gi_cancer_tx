## Endscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) {#emr}

For patients with nodular Barrett's esophagus or small tumors judged to be T1 by endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) can be diagnostic and potentially curative.[@pech652]<!--Pech Gastroenterology  2014 146:652 -->


EMR is likely sufficient for small tumors with favorable patholgic factors:

- Size less than
- Lateral and deep margins clear
- Absence of lymphovascular invasion
- Well- or moderately- differentiated

EMR for high-grade dysplasia [@shaheen2277]

EMR for low-grade dysplasia [@phoa1209] resulted in 25% riskd reduction in progression go HGD.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a technique for deeper endoscopic removal of esophageal lesions using endoscopic cautery, which dissects through the submucosa. ESD has a higher rate of curative resection [@cao751] albiet at the cost of prolonged operative times and increased risk of complications such a bleeding.
