# Esophageal Cancer {#EsoIntro}

For the purposes of this guide, treatment of esophageal cancer can be grouped into several broad categories:

- Endoscopic therapy (superficial tumors)
- Primary surgery (localized tumors)
- Trimodality therapy (locally-advanced tumors)
- Systemic therapy (metastatic or unresectable tumors)

The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups:

Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss.  These tumors may present with bleeding, or with dysphagia without weight loss.  For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so **endoscopic ultrasound** is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis.

Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease.  For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, **PET** is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis.

Endoscopic therapy likely sufficient[Pech Gastroenterology  2014 146:652]

## T2N0

Neoadjuvant chemo not likey to be helpful for early stage disease - FFCD 9901 [Mariette 2416]
Meta-analysis of 5265 patients in 10 studies showed that while neoadjuvant therapy was associated with a reduction in positive margin rate, there was no difference in terms of recurrence or survival.[MOta 176]
