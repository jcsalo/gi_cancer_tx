# Diagnosis

The diagnosis of esophageal cancer is generally made at upper endscopy. Several findings at EGD are important in the subsequent workup and treatment:

 - Location of the tumor from the incisors
 - Length of the tumor
 - Location of the gastroesophageal junction relative to the tumor
 - Presence and extent of Barrett's changes
 - Presence and extent of invasion of tumor into the gastric cardia, particularly along the lesser curvature side. This is best seen with a retroflexed view
